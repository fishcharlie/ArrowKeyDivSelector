# ArrowKeyDivSelector
🌐 Webpage - Arrow Key Div Highlighter

---
This project is meant to use HTML, CSS, and Javascript to highlight 4 `div`'s and toggle between them using the up and down arrow keys. One of the requirements for this project is not being able to use the [jQuery library](https://jquery.com) and only use pure Javascript.
